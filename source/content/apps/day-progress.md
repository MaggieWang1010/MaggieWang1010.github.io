### Tips

#### Time presets

You can use the Shortcuts app to make time presets. For example, you can make a shortcut that sets the day range to `13:00 - 18:00` and run it on the days were you want that range. And another shortcut to reset it back to the normal day range. [Example shortcut.](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/9636a1f2f0624aa787727afd306ff667)

#### Countdown from 8 hours when you decide

You can use a shortcut to make it countdown 8 hours from when you decide. [Example shortcut.](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/39c8db30ce9d456bbbbdfcc8ba5eb136)

#### Reminder about shortcuts

A shortcut can be run from the menu bar, using a global keyboard shortcut, from Spotlight, or from Raycast. You can even use [Shortery](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shortery/id1594183810?mt=12) to make it run automatically, for example, when you change to the work focus.

#### The app does not show up in the menu bar

macOS hides menu bar apps when there is no space left in the menu bar. This is a common problem on MacBooks with a notch. Try quitting some menu bar apps to free up space. If this does not solve it, try quitting Bartender if you have it installed.

#### Can you add widgets?

I plan to add it later this year.

#### Can you add support for iOS?

I plan to do that at some point.

#### Can the end time be the sunset time?

It's not something I plan to add directly to the app, but you can achieve it by making a shortcut that

There are already lots of apps for counting down to a specific date. I wanted to make something more unique. Also, the app name is “Day Progress”.

It's out of scope for this app and there are existing apps for that already.

I don't plan to localize the app.
