Cut and paste files and folders in Finder using Command+X and Command+V. Without this app, you have to first copy (Command+C) and then remember to move (Option+Command+V).

### Frequently Asked Questions {#faq}

#### I have a feature request, bug report, or some feedback

[Send it here.](/feedback?product=Command%20X&referrer=Website-FAQ)

#### Why? I can already use `Option+Command+V`

- It's more logical to cut & paste than copy & move.
- Consistency and muscle memory benefits if you also use Linux or Window.

#### The app does not show up in the menu bar

macOS hides menu bar apps when there is no space left in the menu bar. This is a common problem on MacBooks with a notch. Try quitting some menu bar apps to free up space. If this does not solve it, try quitting Bartender if you have it installed.

#### The app does not work {#not-working}

First, make sure you pressed <kbd>Command+X</kbd> and not <kbd>Command+C</kbd>.

To help me figure out the issue, press <kbd>Command+X</kbd> and <kbd>Command+V</kbd> in Finder, click the “Copy Debug Info” button in the Command X menu bar menu, and then [send the debug info to me](/feedback?product=Command%20X&referrer=Website-FAQ), including a short explanation of what didn't work.

#### Is there any risk of data loss if I forget to paste?

No. The files are not touched until you paste. If you don't paste, the files just stay in place.

#### Can I move files by clicking the “Paste” menu item?

No, you can only use the keyboard shortcuts. The app works by overriding the original keyboard shortcuts. There is no way to override the Finder menu items.

#### Where can I find the changelog?

Go [here](https://apps.apple.com/app/id6448461551) and click “Version History”.

#### Can you localize the app into my language?

I don't have any plans to localize the app.

### Non-App Store Version

A special version for users that cannot access the App Store. It won't receive automatic updates. I will update it here once a year.
